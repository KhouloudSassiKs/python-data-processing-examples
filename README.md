# Student Algorithms Repository

This repository contains Python scripts I developed independently as part of my **practice on CodeSignal**. 
The scripts focus on student-related algorithms such as analyzing borrow durations, displaying scores, and counting student activities. 
All code is my own work.

## Files and Descriptions

### 1. `count-borrow-duration.py`
Calculates cumulative borrow durations for books and identifies books with the maximum borrow time. Durations are formatted as `"HH:MM"`.

### 2. `score-display.py`
Handles score calculations and displays results for students or participants, tracking successes, failures, and cumulative scores.

### 3. `student-count.py`
Counts occurrences of students or emails from activity logs and provides summaries for reporting purposes.

## Usage

- Each Python file can be run independently.
- Example code is included in each file and can be modified for testing different inputs.
- No external dependencies are required; the scripts use only Python's standard library.

**Note:** All code in this repository is my independent work from **CodeSignal practice exercises**.
